# Tryg App: Competitor Analysis & Strategic Playbook

> *"Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are."* — Machiavelli

This analysis examines the elder care app market to identify how Tryg can move from prototype to profitable product.

---

## Executive Summary

| Insight | Implication for Tryg |
|---------|---------------------|
| **B2C elder care apps almost always fail** | Don't build a pure consumer subscription |
| **Life360 won via family anxiety, not features** | Sell peace of mind, not task management |
| **Profitable exits are B2B2C (health plans, municipalities)** | Build for Ældresagen/kommune partnership from day 1 |
| **11% of health apps are used after 30 days** | Design for *caregiver-driven* use, not senior adoption |
| **Most winners charge family, not senior** | Your paying customer is the adult child, not mor/far |

## Part 1: The Market Landscape

### The Winners & What They Do Right

#### 🏆 Life360 — The $1.8B Playbook

**What it is:** Family location sharing + safety alerts

**Revenue Model:**
- **Freemium + family subscriptions** (Silver $8, Gold $15, Platinum $25/month)
- **Hardware** (acquired Tile + Jiobit trackers)
- **Advertising/data** (now 17% of revenue, growing 82% YoY)

**Why it works:**
1. **Solves high-anxiety problem**: "Where is my parent/teen right now?"
2. **Low friction**: Runs in background, no daily engagement required
3. **Network effects**: Whole family uses it, creates switching costs
4. **Multi-segment**: Same app serves teens, seniors, pets → scale

**Unit economics:**
- ARPU: ~$5/month across all users (3-10% convert to paid)
- Churn: Low because families anchor multiple members
- LTV: High due to annual plans and device bundles

> **Tryg Lesson:** Life360 doesn't require seniors to "do" anything. The app works passively. Tryg currently requires active daily engagement — that's a risk.

---

#### 💊 Medisafe — Medication Adherence Leader

**What it is:** Medication reminders + tracking

**Revenue Model:**
- **Freemium consumer** (Premium ~$3-6/month)
- **B2B2C** (pharma companies, health plans pay for users)
- **Enterprise** (medication adherence programs)

**Why it works:**
1. **Critical use case**: Missed meds = hospitalizations
2. **Caregiver visibility**: Adult children can see if parent took meds
3. **Pharma partnerships**: Companies pay to improve adherence to their drugs
4. **Evidence-based**: Can prove ROI (reduced ER visits)

> **Tryg Lesson:** The real buyer is often pharma or health plans, not consumers. "Did mor take her meds?" is exactly what Tryg tracks. That's monetizable with the right partners.

---

#### 👴 Papa — Companion Care for Lonely Elders

**What it is:** "Grandkids on demand" — real humans visit lonely seniors

**Revenue Model:**
- **B2B2C only**: Medicare Advantage plans pay per visit
- Zero direct-to-consumer revenue

**Why it works:**
1. **Addresses social determinants of health (SDOH)** → health plans care
2. **Reduces ER visits** from loneliness-driven depression
3. **Measurable outcomes** → contract renewals

> **Tryg Lesson:** Tryg's "connection features" (family status, thinking of you, weekly questions) address loneliness. If you can prove reduced isolation → health plan contracts.

---

#### 🏠 Honor — Home Care Consolidator

**What it is:** Tech-enabled home care platform (acquired Home Instead for $500M+)

**Revenue Model:**
- **Not an app** — buys/operates home care agencies
- PE-backed roll-up strategy

**Why it matters:**
- Massive fragmented market with demographic tailwinds
- Tech enables quality + efficiency at scale
- PE investors (Webster Equity) continue acquiring under the Honor umbrella

> **Tryg Lesson:** The big money isn't in apps — it's in *operating* care services. Apps are a feature, not the business. Consider: could Tryg be the software layer for Danish home care providers?

---

### The Losers & Why They Failed

| Pattern | Why It Kills Apps | Tryg Risk Level |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Low engagement after download** | 89% of health apps abandoned within 30 days | 🔴 HIGH — Tryg requires daily task completion |
| **Poor senior usability** | Small buttons, confusing flows, no human fallback | 🟡 MEDIUM — Good accessibility work done, needs more |
| **No one paying** | Seniors on fixed income, adult kids won't pay $20/mo | 🔴 HIGH — No validated willingness to pay |
| **Pure B2C model** | CAC too high, LTV too low, churn too high | 🔴 HIGH if staying consumer-only |
| **Surveillance perception** | Seniors reject "monitoring" tools | 🟢 LOW — Tryg's bidirectional design addresses this |

#### Case Studies in Failure

**CareZone** (shut down 2024)
- Was a comprehensive medication + document organizer
- Problem: Too complex, low engagement
- Acquired for talent, not product

**Generic medication reminder apps**
- Free apps with no differentiation
- Can't compete with Medisafe's pharma partnerships
- No path to revenue

---

## Part 2: Revenue Models Ranked

### Option 1: Sell to Ældresagen or Kommune (B2B)

**How it works:** License Tryg to Denmark's largest elder care organization or municipalities as a "digital care coordination tool."

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ✅ One contract = thousands of users | ❌ Long sales cycle (6-18 months) |
| ✅ Government/nonprofit budget = stable | ❌ Procurement bureaucracy |
| ✅ Credibility for international expansion | ❌ May require features you don't have |
| ✅ Don't need to acquire users 1-by-1 | ❌ Lower margins than B2C |

**What Ældresagen would want:**
- GDPR compliance documentation
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration with existing municipal systems
- Privacy controls for seniors
- Danish language (✅ you have this)
- Evidence of effectiveness (pilot data)

**Estimated deal size:** 50-200 DKK per user/year × 1,000-10,000 users = 50K-2M DKK/year

---

### Option 2: Family Subscription (B2C)

**How it works:** Adult child pays monthly to monitor/connect with parent.

**Pricing benchmark:**
| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | 0 kr | Basic task view, 1 relative |
| Tryg+ | 49 kr/mo | Multi-relative, symptom history, doctor reports |
| Tryg Familie | 99 kr/mo | Voice notes, photo sharing, video check-ins |

**Reality check:**
- Expect 3-5% conversion from free to paid
- At 1,000 free users → 30-50 paying → 1,500-5,000 kr/month
- Need 10,000+ users to reach 50K kr/month

> **Verdict:** Sustainable as side income, but not the main play.

---

### Option 3: B2B2C via Health Insurance (Best ROI)

**How it works:** Danish health insurers (Tryg Forsikring, ironically named!) or pension funds (PFA, Danica) subsidize the app for customers.

**Why they'd pay:**
- Reduces claims from falls, medication errors, hospitalizations
- Differentiator in competitive market
- Corporate social responsibility story

**How to approach:**
1. Build a case study with 10-20 families
2. Measure: medication adherence %, symptom logging frequency, "peace of mind" surveys
3. Pitch to insurance innovation teams
4. Offer white-label or co-branded version

**Estimated deal size:** 10-50 DKK per user/month × 5,000-50,000 users = 600K-30M DKK/year

---

### Option 4: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Phase 1: Validate with families (Free/Freemium)**
- Get 100 real families using daily
- Collect engagement data and testimonials

**Phase 2: B2C subscription for revenue (Tryg+ at 49 kr)**
- Fund ongoing development
- Prove willingness to pay

**Phase 3: B2B2C with insurance/municipality**
- Use Phase 1-2 data to pitch
- Enterprise pricing (per-seat license)

---

## Part 3: What to Copy from Winners

### From Life360: The Anxiety Play

Life360's genius is solving a *feeling*, not a feature. Parents don't want "GPS tracking" — they want the feeling that their kid is safe.

**Tryg equivalent:**
> "Mor har det godt" is the feeling. The task checkboxes are just the mechanism.

**Tactical changes:**
1. Make the "peace of mind" summary the FIRST thing relatives see
2. Add a simple notification: "Mor startede sin dag kl 08:15 ✓"
3. Create an "Alt er vel" push notification at end of day

---

### From Medisafe: Prove the ROI

Medisafe gets pharma contracts because they can say: "Users who use our app are 30% more adherent to their medication."

**Tryg equivalent:**
1. Track medication completion rate
2. Track symptom logging frequency
3. After 3 months: generate a "Tryg Rapport" showing engagement metrics
4. Use this in B2B pitches

---

### From Papa: SDOH Angle for Health Plans

Medicare Advantage plans in the US pay for loneliness interventions because loneliness → depression → ER visits.

**Tryg equivalent:**
- Weekly questions, family status, "thinking of you" pings all reduce isolation
- Track "connection events" (pings sent, questions answered)
- Pitch to Danish health plans: "Tryg reduces social isolation for aging-in-place seniors"

---

## Part 4: Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 0 → 100 Users: Do Things That Don't Scale

| Tactic | Effort | Expected Yield |
|--------|--------|----------------|

| Cold email eldercare bloggers for reviews | Low | 5-10 signups + SEO |
| Partner with one hjemmeplejer (home care nurse) | Medium | 10-20 families |
| Local newspaper story ("Danish dev builds app for mor") | Medium | 50-100 signups |

### Phase 100 → 1,000 Users: Content + ASO

| Tactic | Effort | Expected Yield |

| YouTube walkthrough videos | Medium | Trust building |
| Google Ads (limited budget, test keywords) | Medium | Paid acquisition |

### Phase 1,000 → 10,000: B2B Partnerships

| Partner Type | Approach |
|--------------|----------|
| Ældresagen | Pitch as volunteer-facing tool |
| Municipal eldercare (kommune) | Pilot program proposal |
| Tryg Forsikring | Innovation team partnership |
| Home care agencies | White-label solution |

---

## Part 5: Technical Requirements for Scale

### Multi-User Architecture (Your Question)

**Current state:** localStorage (browser-only, single-user)

**Required for real users:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Care Circle                   │
│                                                  │
│  ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐          │
│  │ Senior │   │ Child 1│   │ Child 2│          │
│  │ (Mor)  │   │ (Dig)  │   │ (Søster)│          │
│  └───┬────┘   └───┬────┘   └───┬────┘          │
│      │            │            │                │
│      └────────────┼────────────┘                │
│                   │                              │
│            ┌──────▼──────┐                       │
│            │   Backend    │                      │
│            │ (Firebase/   │                      │
│            │  Supabase)   │                      │
│            └─────────────┘                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Recommended: Firebase (Firestore + Auth + FCM)**

| Feature | Firebase | Supabase | Custom API |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| Setup time | Hours | Hours | Weeks |
| Real-time sync | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in | 🔧 Build yourself |
| Auth | ✅ Google, Apple, email | ✅ Same | 🔧 Build yourself |
| Push notifications | ✅ FCM | 🔧 Third-party | 🔧 Build yourself |
| Offline-first | ✅ Built-in | 🔧 Manual | 🔧 Build yourself |
| Cost | Free tier generous | Free tier generous | $50-200/mo minimum |
| GDPR | EU data residency available | EU option | You control |

**Data model for multi-user:**
```javascript
// Firestore collections
/users/{userId}
/careCircles/{circleId}
/careCircles/{circleId}/members/{userId}
/careCircles/{circleId}/tasks/{taskId}
/careCircles/{circleId}/symptoms/{symptomId}
/careCircles/{circleId}/pings/{pingId}
```

---

### GDPR & Privacy Requirements (Your Question)

**You MUST have:**

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Explicit consent** for health data | Consent modal on signup, granular toggles |
| **Privacy policy** (Danish) | Link in app, explains all data use |
| **Data export** (GDPR Art. 20) | "Download my data" button → JSON/PDF |
| **Right to deletion** (Art. 17) | "Delete my account" → wipes all data |
| **Data minimization** | Only collect what you need |
| **Encryption in transit** | HTTPS (you have this) |
| **Encryption at rest** | Firebase/Supabase handle this |
| **Access controls** | Family members only see their circle |
| **Audit log** | Who viewed what, when (for B2B sales) |

**What you DON'T need (yet):**
- HIPAA (US only)
- MDR certification (unless claiming medical device status)
- ISO 27001 (nice-to-have for enterprise sales)

## Part 6: Strategic Recommendations

### The Machiavellian Path to Riches

#### Move 1: Prove the Concept (Now - 3 months)
- **Goal:** 10-20 real families using Tryg daily for 30+ days
- **Action:** Personal outreach, your network, local community
- **Metric:** 60%+ task completion rate, weekly active users

#### Move 2: Add the Backend (Months 2-4)
- **Goal:** Multi-user sync so real families can connect
- **Action:** Firebase Firestore + Auth
- **Cost:** Free tier, your time only

#### Move 3: Monetize Early (Months 4-6)
- **Goal:** First 10 paying subscribers at 49 kr/month
- **Action:** Tryg+ paywall on premium features
- **Revenue:** 500 kr/month (small but proves willingness to pay)

#### Move 4: Pitch B2B (Months 6-12)
- **Goal:** One pilot with municipality, Ældresagen, or insurer
- **Action:** Use engagement data to build pitch deck
- **Ask:** 50-100K DKK pilot contract

#### Move 5: Scale or Sell (Year 2+)
- **Path A:** Grow B2B contracts → 1M+ DKK ARR → raise funding
- **Path B:** Acquisition target for insurance company's digital health arm
- **Path C:** White-label to other Nordic countries

## Appendix: Competitor Comparison Table

| App | Focus | Revenue Model | ARPU | Tryg Can Copy |
|-----|-------|---------------|------|---------------|
| Life360 | Location | Freemium + Hardware | ~$5/mo | Passive safety feeling |
| Medisafe | Medication | Freemium + B2B | ~$2/mo | Adherence metrics |
| Papa | Loneliness | B2B2C (MA plans) | $0 consumer | SDOH pitch |
| CareZone | All-in-one | Failed | - | Don't overload features |
| Oscar Senior | Simplified launcher | B2B (care homes) | License | Simple UI patterns |

---

## TL;DR — The Brutal Truth

1. **Pure B2C apps in elder care almost always fail.** Don't be one.
2. **Your real customer is the adult child**, not the senior. Build for their anxiety.
3. **The money is in B2B2C** — health plans, municipalities, and insurance companies.
4. **Prove engagement first**, then pitch enterprises with data.
5. **Keep it simple.** Complex apps get abandoned. Life360 works because it's passive.
6. **Multi-user backend is mandatory.** localStorage won't cut it for real families.
7. **GDPR compliance is table stakes** for any Danish/EU partner deal.
