## Changes Made This Session

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` | **NEW** - Circadian theme provider with Morning/Day/Evening/Night logic |
| `src/index.css` | Added `--theme-*` tokens for Dark Mode and `.theme-dark` utility class |
| `src/main.tsx` | Wrapped app with `ThemeProvider` |
| `src/components/ui/LivingBackground.tsx` | Refactored to sync with `ThemeContext` circadian state |
| `src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` | Added manual theme toggle (Auto/Light/Dark) with Zap/Sun/Moon icons |
| `src/components/AmbientDashboard.tsx` | **NEW** - Atmospheric status dashboard for RelativeView |
| `src/components/PeaceOfMindTab.tsx` | Integrated `AmbientDashboard`, replaced old `StatusCard` |
| `src/locales/da.json`, `bs.json`, `tr.json` | Added theme-related translation keys |
| `.agent/workflows/onboarding.md` | **NEW** - Standards enforcement for future agents |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | **NEW** - Backlog for non-critical features |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Added `ThemeContext` to context table and component tree |
| `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` | Added `ThemeContext` to shared resources |
| `docs/LEARNINGS.md` | Documented circadian UI transitions and documentation rigor |

## Key Patterns Discovered

1. **Circadian Theming**: Time-based UI shifts are centralized in `ThemeContext`. Components subscribe via `useTheme()` hook and react to `circadianTheme` (morning/day/evening/night) or `mode` (auto/light/dark).

2. **Atmospheric Status Communication**: The `AmbientDashboard` uses color + motion (not just text) to communicate wellbeing. Teal = calm, Amber = alert, Rose = needs attention.

3. **CSS Variable Orchestration**: All theme-aware colors are defined as `--theme-*` variables in `:root` and overridden in `.theme-dark`. Components use these tokens for instant theme switching.

4. **Mirror Protocol Enforcement**: Features MUST be verified in both Senior and Relative views. The onboarding workflow now mandates this.

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Created `ThemeContext` instead of using CSS-only dark mode | Needed programmatic control for circadian logic + localStorage persistence |
| Split Settings/Share header icons | User feedback indicated cognitive load reduction when separating "Connection" from "Configuration" |
| Created `.agent/workflows/onboarding.md` | User requested a system to enforce standards (typography, documentation) across agent sessions |

---

## Active Issues
- [ ] Some `walkthrough.md` image paths may need adjustment (file:// protocol on Windows)
- [ ] UI_UX_DESIGN.md backlog table still shows items 14/15 as "BACKLOG" despite being complete (should update)

---

## Quick Start for Next Session

1. Run `npm run dev` in `tryg-app/`
2. The current focus is **Dark Mode completed** — next up is backlog items (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`)
3. Start by looking at:
   - `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` for circadian logic
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` for prioritized backlog
   - `.agent/workflows/onboarding.md` for project standards

---

## Standards Reminder
> **Typography**: Base font size is `--font-size-lg` (1.125rem/18px) for senior readability.
> **Mirror Protocol**: Never implement a feature for one role without verifying the other.
> **Documentation Rigor**: Update ARCHITECTURE, DEPENDENCIES, and LEARNINGS after significant changes.

## Session 2 (Afternoon) - Codebase Harmonization

### Project State
- **Last commit**: `6d0e777` - fix(theme): dark mode typography in Min dag tab
- **Dev server**: Running at http://localhost:5173

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/SeniorView.tsx` | Replaced 15 hardcoded Danish strings with `t()` calls; fixed `onToggleLike` prop; theme-aware typography |
| `src/locales/da.json` | Added 13 new translation keys for i18n sweep |
| `src/locales/bs.json` | Added 13 new keys + fixed grammar typo ("Osedmično" → "Sedmično") |
| `src/locales/tr.json` | Added 13 new translation keys |
| `src/data/wordGameData_bs.ts` | **NEW** - 30 Bosnian cultural words for word game |
| `src/data/wordGameData_tr.ts` | **NEW** - 30 Turkish cultural words for word game |
| `src/features/wordGame/useWordGame.ts` | Selects word list based on `i18n.language` |
| `src/features/coffee/CoffeeToggle.tsx` | Added JSDoc documentation |
| `src/features/wordGame/Spillehjoernet.tsx` | Added JSDoc with `@param` definitions |
| `src/index.css` | **BUGFIX** - Removed `overflow: hidden` from body/#root (was blocking scroll) |
| `src/components/ui/LivingBackground.tsx` | **BUGFIX** - Removed `overflow-hidden` + changed `min-h-screen` to `h-full` |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Added harmonization and scroll fix entries |

### Key Bugs Fixed

1. **Scroll Blocked Everywhere**: Multiple nested `overflow-hidden` containers on `body`, `#root`, and `LivingBackground` wrapper. Fixed by removing them and using `h-full` instead of `min-h-screen`.

2. **Dark Mode Typography**: Period headers like "Aften (Kl. 18-21)" used hardcoded `text-stone-800` which was invisible on dark backgrounds. Replaced with `theme-text` class.

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep amber colors in CoffeeToggle | Thematic warmth for coffee, distinct from teal status indicators |
| Create separate word game libraries per locale | Words are cultural idioms, not translatable — each locale needs its own vocabulary |

### Quick Start for Next Session
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Focus areas: ROADMAP.md backlog items
3. Check `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for what's unreleased
