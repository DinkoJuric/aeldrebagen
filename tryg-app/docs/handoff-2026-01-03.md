# Session Handoff - 2026-01-03

## Project State
- **Current branch**: `main` (assumed, will verify)
- **Dev server**: `npm run dev`

## Changes Made This Session
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | Added `@capacitor/android`, `build:android` script |
| `eas.json` | Created Generic Build configuration for Capacitor |
| `app.json` | Created to store Expo Project ID |
| `docs/BUILD_SURVIVAL_GUIDE.md` | Created guide for managing EAS quotas & distribution |
| `android/` | Generated Android native project |

## Key Patterns Discovered
- **EAS for Capacitor**: We are using EAS *only* as a build service. The runtime is pure Capacitor. The `expo` package usually causes conflicts and was uninstalled.
- **PhoneFrame**: The component works responsively: full-screen on mobile (`100dvh`), simulated frame on desktop/tablet.
- **Android Install**: `InstallPrompt.tsx` already handles Chrome's `beforeinstallprompt` event for a native-like install experience.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Manual EAS Config** | The CLI `eas init` hung on interactive prompts. Manually creating `eas.json` + `app.json` was cleaner. |
| **No Paid Apple Account** | User budget is strict. We documented the "Nuclear Option" (AltStore) in the survival guide but recommended Android/Web focus. |
| **Generic Build Profile** | Used standard "Generic" profile in `eas.json` because this is a Capacitor project, not a Managed Expo project. |

## Active Issues
- [ ] iOS distribution is strictly limited by the lack of a paid Developer Account (7-day expiry on Free Tier).

## Quick Start for Next Session
1. **Build**: Project is ready for `npx eas-cli build`.
2. **Docs**: Refer to `docs/BUILD_SURVIVAL_GUIDE.md` for distribution strategy.
3. **Next**: Likely verifying the first cloud build or proceeding with feature work.
