# Session Handoff - 2025-12-22

## Project State
- Current branch: main
- Last commit: d0c3b21 - feat(locales): localized welcome flow for da, bs, tr
- Dev server: active (npm run dev)

## Changes Made This Session
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/locales/*.json` | Added translated strings for Welcome Flow (da, bs, tr). |
| `src/features/onboarding/*` | Implemented `SeniorWelcome` and `RelativeWelcome` with `useTranslation`. |
| `src/AppCore.tsx` | Added Juzu-specific language override logic (`bs`). |
| `docs/*` | Updated Architecture, Roadmap, Changelog, and Learnings. |

## Key Patterns Discovered
- **Mirror Protocol**: Onboarding has distinct flows for Senior (Story) vs Relative (Setup), but they share the same underlying data structure.
- **Juzu Exception**: Specific user `Juzu` triggers Bosnian language and `Beanie Man` avatar. This is hardcoded for the "Wizard of Oz" experience.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Aspect Ratio Revert** | Reverted Scene 1 & 2 videos back to `aspect-video` as `aspect-square` cut off important visual details. Kept Scene 3 square. |
| **Commit Strategy** | Pushed changes to `main` to ensure localization is live for demo. |

## Active Issues
- [ ] **tsc errors**: Build process shows intermittent TypeScript errors that don't stop the dev server.
- [ ] **Log spam**: `firebase-debug.log` appears in parent directory (untracked).

## Quick Start for Next Session
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. The current focus is **Verification of Localization**.
3. Start by checking `src/locales/da.json` to see the structure of the new keys.
