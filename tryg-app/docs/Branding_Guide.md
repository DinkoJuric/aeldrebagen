# Tryg Brand Development Brief

## 1. The Mission(The "Why")
Tryg is not a health tracker.It is a digital porch light.Our goal is to replace the anxious, intrusive "surveillance" of modern elder care(GPS tracking, medical alerts) with a warm, ambient sense of presence.We are building a connection tool that happens to track medication, not a medication tracker that pretends to be friendly.

## 2. The Target Audience(The "Who")
We have a dual audience with conflicting visual needs.The brand must bridge this gap.

*   ** The Senior(Brad, 70 +):** Needs clarity, large touch targets, and high contrast.Dislikes "techy" or clinical aesthetics.Wants to feel dignified, not managed.
*   ** The Relative(Fatima, 40s):** Needs reassurance and efficiency.Wants to see "Everything is OK" in 2 seconds.

## 3. Core Brand Principles(The "How")

    *   ** Hygge over Clinical:** If it looks like a hospital chart, we failed.It should feel like a living room.Use textures, warmth, and soft light.
*   ** Dignity over Control:** We don't "monitor" the senior. We "check in." The language and icons should be empowering, not patronizing.
    *   ** Ambient Presence:** Information should breathe.Use "Living Backgrounds"(gradients that shift with the sun) to convey time and mood subconsciously.

## 4. Visual Direction(The "Look")

### Palette
    *   ** Primary:** Teal & Stone(Calm, grounded, Scandinavian).
*   ** Warmth:** Amber / Golden Hour(Used for "Coffee Mode" and positive reinforcement).
*   ** Night:** Deep Indigo(For the circadian night mode).
*   ** Avoid:** "Medical Blue"(too cold) or "Emergency Red"(too stressful).

### Typography
A humanist sans - serif.Highly readable at large sizes, but warm. (e.g., something like Nunito, Lato, or Inter with soft weights).

### Iconography
    * Solid, Friendly Shapes.No thin strokes that are hard for old eyes to see.
*   ** Metaphorical:** Use a "Coffee Pot" for availability, a "Porch Light" for safety, a "Constellation" for family.

## 5. Deliverables Required

    *   ** Logo & App Icon:** Something that symbolizes "Connection/Safety" without using a shield, a cross, or a pill.Think: Light, knots, circles, warmth.
*   ** Color System:** A semantic palette(Success, Warning, Night, Day) that passes WCAG AAA contrast standards.
*   ** UI Component Library:**
    *   ** The "Big Button":** How do we make a button look pressable and inviting for shaky hands ?
    *   ** The "Living Gradient":** Define the hex codes for Morning, Day, Evening, Night.
*   ** Illustration Style:** A set of 3 - 4 key visual assets(The Empty State, The Success State, The "Coffee Invitation").

## 6. Brand Personality(The "Voice")

    *   ** We are:** Warm, Calm, Patient, Danish, Honest.
*   ** We are NOT:** Alarmist, Clinical, Childish, "Techy," or Controlling.
