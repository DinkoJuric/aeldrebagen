# Tryg App - Feature Ideation

A living document for brainstorming features that could make Tryg more valuable.

> **Core Philosophy Shift**: Tryg is not a monitoring tool. It's a **shared family space** where connection flows both ways. The senior is a **host and contributor**, not a data source.

## 🌟 Connection-First Features (Priority)

### Bidirectional Visibility ("Mirror Features")
The key to avoiding surveillance: **reciprocity by default**.

| Senior Sees | Family Sees |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Louise er på arbejde" | "Mor har det godt" |
| "Børnene er kommet hjem fra skole" | "Farmor tog sin morgen medicin" |
| "Emma løb 5km i morges" | "Farmor har gået en tur i haven" |

**Implementation**: Add a `FamilyStatus` component that shows what the relative is doing - work, traveling, home, etc. Makes the senior feel part of daily life, not isolated.

---

### Shared Moments (Not Data)
Replace "health dashboard" with **shared experiences**.

**Photo Exchange**
- **Daily Photo Ritual**: Family sends one photo → Senior sees it as "Dagens Billede" (already built!)
- **Two-Way**: Senior can share photos back (simplified camera UI)
- **Reactions**: Simple emoji reactions (❤️ 😊 👍) on shared content

**Voice Notes** 
- 30-second voice clips instead of text (better for motor issues)
- Grandchildren recording "Godmorgen Farmor!" as morning greeting
- Senior can respond with voice, not typing

**"Jeg tænker på dig" Button**
- One-tap "thinking of you" ping
- Visual: Heart animation on recipient's screen
- No response required - just warmth

---

### Weekly Rituals

**Family Question of the Week**
> "Hvad var det bedste øjeblik denne uge?"

- Everyone answers (family + senior)
- Creates shared stories and memories
- Displayed as a carousel of answers

**Sunday Coffee Chat**
- Scheduled video drop-in time
- "Kafferum" indicator shows who's available
- Low-pressure, can leave anytime

---

### Dignity-Preserving Help Requests

Instead of: "Alert: Mom needs help"
Reframe as: **Mutual exchange**

| Senior Can Offer | Senior Can Request |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Jeg kan hjælpe med at lytte" | "Kan nogen ringe mig i dag?" |
| "Jeg har en god opskrift" | "Hjælp til indkøb denne uge" |
| "Vil gerne høre om jeres dag" | "Følgeskab til lægen" |

**The senior contributes value, not just receives care.**

## 💡 "Dancing at the Wedding" Features

Features that connect health goals to **meaningful life moments**:

### Milestone Celebrations

- Connect streaks to personal goals, not abstract metrics

### Memory Triggers
- "I dag for 3 år siden: Familietur til Skagen"

## 🔒 Anti-Surveillance Design Principles

1. **Notification when viewed**: "Louise så din opdatering" - interaction, not silent watching
2. **Share controls**: "Del kun med nær familie / alle / kun mig"
3. **Temporary sharing**: "Del min placering de næste 2 timer"
4. **Pause mode**: "Gå på pause" - take a break from sharing
5. **Senior initiates**: Most data sharing should be senior-triggered, not automatic

## 🎯 High-Value / Low-Effort (MVP+1)

| Feature | Connection Value | Effort |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Two-way status ("Louise er...") | ★★★★★ | 2h |
| "Tænker på dig" one-tap ping | ★★★★★ | 1h |
| Voice note sharing | ★★★★☆ | 4h |
| Simple photo sharing from senior | ★★★★☆ | 3h |
| Emoji reactions on photos | ★★★★☆ | 2h |
